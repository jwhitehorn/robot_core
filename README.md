## Overview

Open design for a programable real-time robotics controller.

See [Byte Code](https://github.com/jwhitehorn/robot_core/wiki/Byte-Code).

## Status

This project is in a pre-alpha state, or in other words; Robot Core is currently a rough prototype. 
With that said, it's design, function, and features will change drastically as it evolves.
